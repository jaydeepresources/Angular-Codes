    Achieve the maximum speed possible on the Web Platform today, and take it
    further, via Web Workers and server-side rendering. Angular puts you in
    control over scalability. Meet huge data requirements by building data
    models on RxJS, Immutable.js or another push-model. Build features quickly
    with simple, declarative templates. Extend the template language with your
    own components and use a wide array of existing components. Get immediate
    Angular-specific help and feedback with nearly every IDE and editor. All
    this comes together so you can focus on building amazing apps rather than
    trying to make the code work.
